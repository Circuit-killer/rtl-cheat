# Y86

Simplified version of x86.

Likely a pun on "why 86?".

5 stage classic pipeline.

No one knows the official spec however: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13055154/list-of-y86-commands>

Verilog implementations:

Assemblers and emulators:

- <http://y86.js.org/> <https://github.com/quietshu/y86> amazing js pipeline level visual simulation.

    A bit hard to understand however.

    Terminology is that of a digram found copy pasted in several university courses without attribution. Great.

    - <http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/simguide.pdf> looks like the best one
