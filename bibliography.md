# Bibliography

Google hits a lot on old university course materials. Some good, some crappy. Almost nothing on GitHub... Good resources are *very* scarce.

Introduction tutorials:

- <http://esd.cs.ucr.edu/labs/tutorial/> many examples
- <http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/scott.roy/DCD3/>
- <http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese171/vhdl/vhdl_primer.html>

Language references:

- <http://vhdl.renerta.com/mobile/index.html>
- <http://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/VHDL/summary.html>. Very good.

Examples:

- <https://github.com/marceloboeira/vhdl-examples> a few simple examples, but no test benches?
- <https://github.com/silverjam/VHDL> medium complexity examples, with test benches
- <http://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/VHDL/samples/samples.html> not many, but good examples, including a square root calculator

YouTube without source:

- <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbUe5SLMSZlSzCuJP81lU0A> has a ton of samples

Cool projects:

- <https://hernan.de/blog/2015/06/16/vlsi-final-project/>, also talks about synthesization done via <https://www.mosis.com/>
- <https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_Webserver>
- <https://github.com/fabioperez/space-invaders-vhdl>
- <https://github.com/primiano/tetris-vhdl>

Utility libraries:

Language agnostic circuit design:
