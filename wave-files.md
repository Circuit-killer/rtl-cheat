# Wave files

The output of a simulation is a wave file, which contains the voltages on every wire of the system at every step of time.

## Formats

### vcd

### Value change dump

Simple, human readable, but not very efficient not general.

Defined in the Verilog standard, and generated by the `$dump*` Verilog commands.

Represents signals in function of type on all observed wires.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump>

Defined with the VHDL standard.

Can be generated by VHDL simulations tools like GHDL.

ASCII based.

Only shows signals that changed at each point in time.

Use VCD as input for Verilog simulation:

- <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.verilog/LZOfMlAhr5U> says signal strength is missing. But this is notably possible in extended VCD. 

#### Extended VCD

#### EVCD

Introduced in the Verilog 2001 standard. Also contains signal strength.

Extended VCD.

### ghd

### GHDLwave

Binary format created by `ghdl`, can be read by `gtkwave`.

### SHM

Cadence thing.
