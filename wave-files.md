# Wave files

The output of a simulation is a wave file, which contains the voltages on every wire of the system at every step of time.

## Formats

### vcd

### Value change dump

Represents signals in function of type on all observed wires.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump>

Defined with the VHDL standard.

Can be generated by VHDL simulations tools like GHDL.

ASCII based.

Only shows signals that changed at each point in time.

### ghd

### GHDLwave

Binary format created by `ghdl`, can be read by `gtkwave`.
