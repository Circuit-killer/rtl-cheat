Higher level design concepts.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_design_(electronics)>

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_change_order> (ECO)

-   Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)

-   Multi mode multi corner (MMMC)

-   Macros: <http://asic-soc.blogspot.co.uk/2007/11/what-is-difference-between-soft-macro.html> Hard macro looks like a custom hand-written per-project cell.

    There are also netlist level macros (firm macros), and soft macros (just plain RTL).
