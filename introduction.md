# Introduction

## Digital

VHDL is made for digital design: every wire can basically have two voltage values.

There is an extension for analog design: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL-AMS>

For mostly analog projects, consider SPICE.

## Testbench

Usually non-synthesizable test driver circuit.

We use the suffix `_tb` to indicate testbench files.
