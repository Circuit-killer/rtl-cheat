# Synopsys

University courses seem like the best option to learn their stuff? They have a cheap license for students.

Major tools:

- design compiler: synthesis: RTL -> gate level RTL
- IC compiler (`icc`): place and route: RTL -> GDSII
- PrimeTime: verifications like timing and power

Couldn't find any free Synopsys official tutorials
