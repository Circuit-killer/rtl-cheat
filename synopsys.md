# Synopsys

University courses seem like the best option to learn their stuff? They have a cheap license for students.

Major tools:

- VCS
- design compiler: synthesis: RTL -> gate level RTL
- IC compiler (`icc`)
- PrimeTime: verifications like timing and power

Couldn't find any free decent Synopsys official tutorials. Likely semi-illegal. Lab notes are your best bet.

## ICC2

Place and route: RTL -> GDSII.

Replaced ICC at some point.

`--help` is short and teaches all you need to know about CLI options. Kudos.

## Verdi
