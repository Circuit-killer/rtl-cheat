# GTKWave

Major open source wave file viewer. Supports several formats, notably `.vcd`.

Besides the viewer, it also has several CLI tools to convert between formats.

TODO:

- at startup, show all signals. Can be done by shift clicking all signals on UI.
- at startup, fit simulation to window.

## Collaboration

On SourceForge, issues can only be opened by admins, so I guess mailing list is the way... scary: <gtkwave-users@lists.sourceforge.net>

And every email is first moderated before appearing on the SourceForge archive.....

## Trivia

Author Anthony Bybell works at AMD as of 2016, previously 15 years at IBM CPU design: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-bybell-00a2533> A ton of patents.
