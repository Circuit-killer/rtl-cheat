How to transform VHDL into a circuit

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_synthesis> first step, transform RTL into gates.

That is the whole point of using VHDL instead of C.

## Non-synthesizable constructs

Many constructs are non-synthesizable.

There is an official synthesizable subset of VHDL.
